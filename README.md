# WR Prospect Ranking Application

Our application is a database focused on storing college football wide receivers that are either currently
in the NFL or are planning on it. The aim to grade player performance in college in order to predict how successful their NFL career will be. It utilizes a local MySQl database to store player information. All database schema is located in
the "Database Creation" folder. The "templates" folder contains all of the HTML templates for the front end of the application.
The application uses Python and Flask to interface with the database and the front end.
